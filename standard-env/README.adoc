= standard environment examples

The GAE https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/about-the-standard-environment[standard
environment] supports two kinds of web application:

* Standard, Java Servlet applications.  This kind of application
  consists of a single WAR directory.

* Services-based applications.  This kind of application is composed
  of one or more WAR directories, each of which acts as an independent
  service.

The https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/java/[Java Standard
Environment documentation] covers both cases.

`boot-gae` is designed to support both application styles from one
code base.  Services may be developed as standard, stand-alone servlet
applications, and then integrated (as microservices) into a
service-based application.  Quasi-REPL responsiveness is supported in
both cases.

With `boot-gae`, the programmer configures applications by writing a
`build.boot` file and some `edn` files.  The `boot-gae` system then
generates the required WAR directories (and their contents)
automatically.

The sample code is designed to demonstrate both cases.  Two of the
examples (`greeter` and `uploader`) can be developed as standard servlet
apps.  The `microservices-app` example assembles those two apps (as
services) together with the `coordinator` service to create a
service-based app.

* link:greeter[greeter] - a "hello world" app that can be used as
  either as a standard servlet app or a microservice in a
  service-based app
* link:uploader[uploader] - an app that can be used as either as a standard servlet
   app or a microservice in a service-based app.  Demonstrates basic
   file upload functionality.
* link:microservices-app[microservices-app] - demonstrates assembly of an application from
  (possibly independent) services; cannot be built and run as a
  standard servlet app.
* link:coordinator[coordinator] - an app designed to be used as the default service of a
  services-based app.


== getting started

IMPORTANT: you do not need a GAE account to experiment!  The GAE SDK
contains everything you need to run webapps on the local devserver;
you only need a GAE account if you want to deploy to the production
servers.

NOTE: Use of App Engine services such as the Datastore is beyond the
scope of these examples.  Their sole purpose is to demonstrate the use
of https://github.com/migae/boot-gae[boot-gae] to get Clojure webapps
up and running on GAE with a repl-like development environment.

Start by building and running link:greeter[greeter] as a standard
servlet app.

Once you're comfortable working with it as a standard servlet app,
build it as a service.  As explained in the
link:greeter/README.adoc[README], this involves a minor change in the
`build.boot` file.  _You will not directly `gae/run` the service!_
Instead, you will build all the services required by your
service-based app, and then assemble and run the app (see
link:microservices-app[microservices-app] for details).

== how it works

The link:greeter[greeter] README file contains a detailed explanation
of how `boot-gae` works for building servlet apps and services; the
README for link:microservices-app[microservices-app] explains how
`boot-gae` assembles a service-based app from independently developed
services.

Very briefly, the most obvious difference between a servlet app and a
services app is in the root directory.  For a servlet, the root
directory (default: `target/`) will contain `WEB-INF` and any public
resources (like `index.html`).  This directory will be created and
populated automatically by `boot-gae`.  There are some other
differences involving configuration files; for example, a service will
have a `<module>` element in its `appengine-web.xml` file, and a
servlet app will not. But `boot-gae` handles all the housekeeping
transparently, so the programmer will typically not need to even know
about this, so long as the `build.boot` and `edn` files are properly
configured.

WARNING: Services must be installed (`boot install`) before they can
be assembled into an app. This is because the `build.boot` file for
the service-based app will list services as `checkout` dependencies.
See the README for link:microservices-app[microservices-app] for details.

For example, if you build `greeter` as a servlet app, the `target`
directory will have this structure:

[source,sy]
----
target/
    WEB-INF/
    favicon.ico
    index.html
    scripts/
    styles/
----

By contrast, building a service will have the same structure, but with
the insertion of an intermediate sub-directory with the service name.
In the case of `greeter` as a service:

[source,ch]
----
target/
    greetings/
        WEB-INF/
        favicon.ico
        index.html
        scripts/
        styles/
----

The reason for this is that in the assembled service application, each
service must be included in a top-level directory of the application's
`target` directory.  For example, with the `microservices-app` example
we have (truncated):

[source,sh]
----
target/
    META-INF/
        ...
    default/
        ...
    greetings/
        WEB-INF/
        favicon.ico
        index.html
        scripts/
        styles/
    uploader/
        ...
----

Here `default` is actually the `coordinator` service, automatically
renamed to make it the default service.


WARNING: If you build as a servlet app, and then you want to build as a
service, you need to delete the `target` directory first. `gae/target`
will by default remove the target directory, but that is different in
the two cases: for servlets it is `target/`; for a service named `foo`,
it will be `target/foo/`.  So building the service will delete
`target/foo/` but not `target/`, which leaves detritus from the servlet
build in `target/`.


== quasi-REPL

We don't have a genuine REPL, but we do have reload-on-refresh, which
is almost as good.  You edit your Clojure code in the source tree, and
your changes will be picked up when you refresh the web page.

==== for servlet apps

Just run the `gae/monitor` task in a separate terminal session.  This
is a convenience task that composes boot's `watch` task and some
other tasks, such that changes to the source tree are propagated to
the appropriate place in the output dir.  This is required by the
security constraints of GAE, which prevent it from accessing anything
outside of the web app root directory.

Behind the scenes, `gae/build` by default inserts a `reloader` filter
in the generated app; this filter monitors the web app directories and
reloads any changed namespaces.

WARNING: When you are ready to deploy to production, you want to omit
the `reloader` filter; use the `-p` flag on `gae/build` to do this.
For details, see the `boot-gae`
https://github.com/migae/boot-gae/doc/task.adoc[task documentation].

==== for services

If you have services that interact - for example, you might have a
data-service that is called by a presentation-service - you might need
to interactively develop them simultaneously.  You can do this by
running the service-based app and then running `gae/monitor` from the
project root director of each service (_not_ from the service app's
root directory).

From the service root dir, you will run `gae/monitor` as for servlet
apps, but you will add a `target` task to the pipeline, using the `-d`
flag to pass the directory path of the service-based app (here,
`microservices-app`).  For example, to interactively work with the
`greeter` service from the `microservices-app` start by running the
app:


[source,sh]
----
microservices-app/ $ boot gae/run
----

Then, from the `greeter` project:

[source,sh]
----
greeter/ $ boot gae/monitor -s
----

This uses the `:app-dir` entry of the `:module` map in the `:gae` map
in `build.boot` to determine where to copy changed files.

== troubleshooting

* Note that services must by installed before they can be assembled
  into a micro-services app.


== obsolete


To see the transient `web.xml.edn` and `*.clj` files used to configure the app, use the `-k` switch with `build`:

[source,sh]
----
$ ./boot.sh gae/build -k gae/target gae/run
----

Note the use of `gae/target` rather than the built-in `target` task.

NOTE: Use of `boot.sh` is optional; you can also just run `$ boot
gae/build`, etc.  `boot.sh` uses the JVM options in
`./.boot-jvm-options`.  See
https://github.com/boot-clj/boot/wiki/JVM-Options[JVM Options].

To get a repl-like dev environment, open a second terminal and start a
monitor:

[source,shell]
----
$ boot gae/monitor
----

The `gae/monitor` task is a convenience wrapper that uses boot's
`watch` task to detect changes to the source tree, then propagates
changes to the correct target dirctory.

Now you can edit the source, and your changes will be included when
you reload the webpage.  For example, go to
`http://localhost:8080/hello/bob`.  Then edit the greeting message in
`src/clj/greetings/hello.clj`.  Save your edit, then reload the page.

If you need to change the configuration, for example to add another
servlet, you'll have to restart the server.  Rerun `boot gae/build
target` to reconfigure the webapp, then run `boot gae/run` again.

Remember that with boot it is not enough to run `gae/build`; you than have
to run the `target` task to put the results of the build on disk where
appengine expects them.

== troubleshooting

```
java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: clojure/lang/Var
```

Check `<build-root>/WEB-INF/lib` to make sure your jars are there.
You probably did not run `gae/libs`.

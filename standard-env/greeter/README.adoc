= greeter

A simple https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/java/[Google App
Engine] webapp, written in 100% https://clojure.org/[Clojure], built
with http://boot-clj.com/[Boot].

IMPORTANT: You do not need a GAE account to experiment!  The GAE SDK
contains everything you need to run webapps on the local devserver;
you only need a GAE account if you want to deploy to the production
servers.

NOTE: Use of App Engine services such as the Datastore is beyond the scope of
this example.  Its sole purpose is to demonstrate the how easy it is
to use https://github.com/migae/boot-gae[boot-gae] to get a Clojure
webapp up and running on GAE with a repl-like development environment.


== getting started

Fork or clone
https://github.com/migae/boot-gae-examples[boot-gae-examples].

Change directory to `standard-env/greeter` and edit `build.boot` to
set the `:app-dir` entry in the `:module` map of the `:gae` map to
point to wherever you installed the repo.  Then run:

[source,shell]
----
$ boot gae/build gae/run
----

WARNING: The first time you run `boot` with the GAE Java SDK
dependency, the SDK zip file will be downloaded.  This is a large file
so it may take a _very_ long time; be patient.  To monitor progress,
use the `-vv` switch with the `boot` command, e.g. `$ boot -vv help`
will download the dependencies before showing the help screen, and
`-vv` will display download progress.


To see the transient `web.xml.edn` and `*.clj` files used to configure
the app, use the `-k` switch with `build`:

[source,sh]
----
$ boot gae/build -k gae/run
----

Note the use of `gae/target` rather than the built-in `target` task.

NOTE: Use of `boot.sh` is optional; you can also just run `$ boot
gae/build`, etc.  `boot.sh` uses the JVM options in
`./.boot-jvm-options`.  See
https://github.com/boot-clj/boot/wiki/JVM-Options[JVM Options].

To get a repl-like dev environment, open a second terminal and start a
monitor:

[source,shell]
----
$ boot gae/monitor
----

The `gae/monitor` task is a convenience wrapper that uses boot's
`watch` task to detect changes to the source tree, then propagates
changes to the correct target dirctory.  A `reloader` filter generated
by the `gae/build` task will then reload the changed namespaces when
the page is refreshed.

Now you can edit the source, and your changes will be included when
you reload the webpage.  For example, go to
`http://localhost:8080/hello/bob`.  Then edit the greeting message in
`src/clj/greetings/hello.clj`.  Save your edit, then reload the page.

If you need to change the configuration, for example to add another
servlet, you'll have to restart the server.  Rerun `boot gae/build
gae/target` to reconfigure the webapp, then run `boot gae/run` again.

Remember that with boot it is not enough to run `gae/build`; you than
have to run the `target` task to put the results of the build on disk
where appengine expects them.  Be sure to use `gae/target`, not the
built-in `target` task.

= build as a service

Building `greeter` as a service is simple:

* add a `:module` entry to the `:gae` map in your `build.boot` file,
  giving e.g.

[source,clojure]
----
 :gae {:app-id "microservices-app"  ; +project+
       :module {:name "greeter"
                :app-dir (str (System/getProperty "user.home")
                              "/boot/boot-gae-examples/standard-env/microservices-app")}
       :version +version+}
----

* use the `--service` switch when running the `gae/build` and `gae/monitor` tasks.

* build each service separately using `boot gae/build -s`
* install each service jar locally:  `boot install -f target/<servicename>/<servicejar>`

== troubleshooting

```
java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: clojure/lang/Var
```

Check `<build-root>/WEB-INF/lib` to make sure your jars are there.
You probably did not run `gae/libs`.

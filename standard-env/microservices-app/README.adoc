= microservice-app

A sample application demonstrating assembly of a service-based
application in the GAE Standard Environment.

Note that there is no source code for this project; it will assemble
service components into an app.

Steps:

1.  Build each service using the `-s` (`--service`) switch, e.g.

[source,sh]
----
$ cd greeter
$ boot gae/build -s
$ boot install -f target/greeter/greeter-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
----

2. Switch to the `microservices-app` dir, build and run:

[source,sh]
----
$ cd ../microservices-app
$ boot gae/assemble gae/run
----

To interactively develop services, run `boot gae/monitor -s` in the
root directory of each service project.

NOTE: Currently you will see some warning messages, e.g. "Checkout
deps missing from :dependencies in env: tmp.services/main,
tmp/greeter, tmp/uploader".  You can ignore this, or you can add the
service components to the `:dependencies` vector.

NOTE: You will also see "Classpath conflict: org.clojure/clojure
version 1.8.0 already loaded, NOT loading version 1.4.0".  This is caused by

== how it works

* the service components must be installed (or available from a repo)

* service components must be listed in the `:checkouts` vector of `build.boot`.

* the `services.edn` file must be properly written; this should be
  self-evident from the sample code (in link:config/services.edn[config/services.edn]).

* the directory containing `services.edn` must be listed in `:source-paths`

* the component services must have the correct `:gae` map in their `build.boot` files, e.g.

[source,clojure]
----
 :gae {:app-id "microservices-app"  ; +project+
       :version +version+
       :module {:name "greeter"
                :app-dir (str (System/getProperty "user.home")
                              "/boot/boot-gae-examples/standard-env/microservices-app")}}
----

* for each service, make sure the `:module :name` value in the
  service's `build.boot` matches the `:module` name in the
  `:checkouts` key of the app's `build.boot` and the `:service` entry
  in `services.edn`.

NOTE: The `services.edn` will probably go away, since `:checkouts` has
all the information needed by `gae/assemble`.
